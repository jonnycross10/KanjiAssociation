# Description
This is a python application that will prompt you for a kanji and continuously quiz you on kanji readings(Romaji) based the last character of the previous kanji until you get one wrong!

# Note
This is a primitive version of a full application I want to build out and put onto a website. This application is probably succeptible to repetitive loops and bugs. I coded this thing in like 2 hours and didn't do much testing.

# Prerequisites
The python version I used is 3.8.10

I had to install 2 libraries: 

```
pip install jaconv
```
```
pip install jisho_api
```

# Instructions
The core game loop is run by running the python file kanji.py
