In the future I will probably take the basics out of here and put it into an api, with a front end that calls it and deploy it to a website. For now it is just a simple python program.

#Prerequisites
The python version I used is 3.8.10
I had to install 2 libraries: 
pip install jaconv
pip install jisho_api
jisho_api

#Instructions
The core game loop is run by running the python file kanji.py
